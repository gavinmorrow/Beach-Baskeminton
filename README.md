# Beach-Baskeminton

A wacky combination of basketball, beach volleyball, and badminton.

## Gameplay

1. The game is played in seven 3-minute intervals.
2. The referee begins each interval by placing the ball between the rackets of the two players. At the sound of the whistle, each player will vie for control of the ball.
3. Points are scored when the ball enters the hoop and goes through the other side.
4. Hands and feet may not be used. This is considered a foul, and the ball will be turned over to the other side.
5. There is no out-of-bounds, but players are incentivized to keep the ball near the shared basket because this is where they both score.
6. When the ball goes over the backboard and hits the floor on the other side without interference, this is called a 'rainbow' and it affords the player four points. Rainbows may only be counted when the score of at least one of the teams is divisible by three, not counting zero.
7. In the event of a tie after the seventh interval, the winner will be determined by the results of an air guitar contest, judged by the referee.
This two-player sport involves using badminton rackets to attempt to put a miniature beach ball into a basketball hoop. It is typically played in an indoor gym, and professionals will have a referee, ensuring that the rules of game play are followed.
